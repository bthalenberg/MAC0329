MAC0329 - Álgebra Booleana e Aplicações no Projeto de Arquitetura de Computadores

This is the final project of an undergraduate course on boolean algebra and computer architecture. 
It consists in an implementation of a simplified computer ["Hipo"](https://www.ime.usp.br/~jstern/software/hipo/Hipo.pdf).

```EP1``` was a warm-up exercise. ```EP2``` implements the ALU (arithmetic/logic unit), and ```EP3``` is the final architecture.
